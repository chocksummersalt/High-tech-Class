"Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather." ~Tom Wolfe, on New York City

The island of Manhattan and the neighboring boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx are home to many of the greatest sites and most diverse cultures and histories in the entire world, offering visitors a wealth of opportunities to explore, adventure, and have fun.

It's virtually impossible to see and do all of the things you read or hear about New York City, be it Broadway plays, Yankees games, Frisbee at Central Park, dancing all night at a club, or enjoying first light during a sunrise stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge. While overwhelming to many visitors,
 the very vastness of New York's unique personality is an integral part of what makes New York City what it is.
